# Card-Game

Card flip is a fun card pairing game that revolves around different types of card faces to be matched  
by clicking the cards to reveal the faces behind.   
I used the faces of my favorite artists, enjoy!

## UX

This game is for everyone, it is a type of casual game that you will play when you find yourself at a waiting room,bank queue   
or any other place that you may find yourself killing time: it is fun, simple and straight to the point.

## Features

-Request players to enter a username in order to start
- It displays the username with a welcome note on screen
- Timer starts once the game begins
- 2 different Sounds when a player clicks and when a match is made
- Sound toggle option available 
- At the end of the game a celebratory gif is displayed
- Timer stops
- Leader board displays time spent playing the game, the player with the best time record is on top 

**Future Implementation**
1. I would like to improve the game to remember each player and keep their progress across multiple visits
2. Broaden the scope and  provide a two player option.

## Testing

1. Jamsmine test framework was used:   
kindly refer to test-folder attached and start the test.html to see test results.
