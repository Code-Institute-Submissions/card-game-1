# Card-Game

Card flip is a fun pairing game, that revolves around pairs of different types of card faces to be matched  
by clicking the cards to revel the faces behind.   
I used the faces of my favorite artists, enjoy!

## UX

This game is for everyone, it is that game that you will play when you find yourself at some waiting room,bank que   
or anyother place that you may need to wind off time: it is fun,simple and straight to the point.

## Features

-Request players to enter a user name in order to straight
- It displays the user name with a welcome note on screen
- Timer starts at the start of the game 
- two differnt kinds of Sound when a player clicks and when a match is made
- Sound toggle option available 
- At the end of the game a celebratory gif comes on 
- Timer stops
- Leader board displays time spent playing the game, displaying the player with the best time record on top 

**Future Implementation**
1. I will like to improve the game to remember each player and keep their progress
2. Broaden the scope and  provide a two player option.
